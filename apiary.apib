# Birdeye
Birdeye helps businesses grow through happy customers. Over 80,000 businesses use Birdeye everyday to attract new leads with Listings, Reviews and Referrals, convert them into customers with Webchat, Appointments, and Payments, and delight those customers with Surveys, Ticketing, and Insights - all in one place.

The Birdeye APIs are built on HTTP and are RESTful APIs.

* Uses resource-oriented URLs.
* Uses built-in HTTP capabilities for passing parameters and authentication.
* Responds with standard HTTP response codes to indicate errors.
* Requests and responses payload attached with all the mentioned APIs, you may choose your preferred language per the integration requirement.


### Authentication and Rate limiting

To call a Birdeye API, you need a valid API key. It can be fetched via the Birdeye dashboard and is a confidential key.

There is a limit to calling APIs with each API key [connect with the support team to get the current limit]. If too many requests are made within the threshold timeframe, an error will be returned in the response.

### Pagination

Multiple API supporting pagination. These APIs have two parameters sindex and count.


* <b>sindex:</b> is the start index
* <b>count:</b> No. of records, you want to fetch.


> __Note__
> - _Deep Pagination with record window greater than 100k is not supported. Either reduce the sindex + count to be less than equal to 100k or use appropriate filters to narrow down your result set._



<b>For example :</b>

* Suppose you have to fetch 20 records:
<pre><code>
API call 1 -> sindex=0, count 10
API call 2 -> sindex -> 10, count 10.
</pre></code>

* To fetch 100kth record:
<pre><code>
sindex = 99000 and count = 1000
will just work fine as sindex + count = 100000 which is less than 100,000.
</pre></code>

* If you fetch more than 100kth records:
<pre><code>
sindex = 99000 and count = 1001, sindex + count = 100001
which is greater than 100,000. Thus, you'll receive an error in response.
</pre></code>

### HTTP Status Codes
Every API response will have an HTTP status code.

* <b>200 - OK:</b> API request is successful
* <b>202 - Accepted:</b> The API request has been accepted for processing.
* <b>400 - Bad Request:</b> The API request was unacceptable, often due to a missing or invalid parameter.
* <b>404 - Not Found:</b> The requested resource does not exist.
* <b>429 - Rate Limited:</b> You have made too many requests within the threshold timeframe.
* <b>500 - Internal Server Error:</b> Something went wrong on our end. Please get in touch with support.

### Error Response

Birdeye API will return a validation error in case of missing/invalid input in the request. The response will return the errorCode and errorMessage.

For example :
<pre><code>
{
    "code": 1161,
    "message": "Invalid API key"
}
</pre></code>

While the servers were polite, they lacked the professionalism normally expected at most dining establishments...you know, simple things like the waiter introducing himself by name or dropping by to see how we liked the food or refilling our drinks. The minestrone soup was pretty good but the fried calamari was bland, rubbery, obviously over cooked, and did I mention bland. The linguini pescatora was also inconsistent. The pasta in the dish was excellent but the calamari was once again over cooked and rubbery, I got a couple of clams that were not cleaned resulting in a few mouthfuls of dirt, and the shrimp was once again over cooked. We also ordered the margherita pizza with mushrooms and that was pretty good. Overall, we cannot recommend this place.",

Great sauce but come on! 4 very thin slices of veal w/veggies & red potatoes, he was starving when we got home!:( At $24!!! Ridiculously stingy! My lamb shank & mashed potatoes was superb! No veggies though:( $19 We won't be returning, I was not impressed, I'd rather go to North Beach w/ real Italian dining:) they do have good food but they need to step it up a notch for the prices they charge, I hope they read they're review's so they can change things, Good luck",
