While the servers were polite, they lacked the professionalism normally expected at most dining establishments...you know, simple things like the waiter introducing himself by name or dropping by to see how we liked the food or refilling our drinks. The minestrone soup was pretty good but the fried calamari was bland, rubbery, obviously over cooked, and did I mention bland. The linguini pescatora was also inconsistent. The pasta in the dish was excellent but the calamari was once again over cooked and rubbery, I got a couple of clams that were not cleaned resulting in a few mouthfuls of dirt, and the shrimp was once again over cooked. We also ordered the margherita pizza with mushrooms and that was pretty good. Overall, we cannot recommend this place.",

Great sauce but come on! 4 very thin slices of veal w/veggies & red potatoes, he was starving when we got home!:( At $24!!! Ridiculously stingy! My lamb shank & mashed potatoes was superb! No veggies though:( $19 We won't be returning, I was not impressed, I'd rather go to North Beach w/ real Italian dining:) they do have good food but they need to step it up a notch for the prices they charge, I hope they read they're review's so they can change things, Good luck",
